Framework to Build Stepped Wizards in SwiftUI

This is a highly modularized wizard in SwiftUI. It was initially developed to provide a wizard approach to adding a ping or port scan but could be wired into any tool, just swap out the labels and images. It's also pre-localized to support adding non-English language support.
